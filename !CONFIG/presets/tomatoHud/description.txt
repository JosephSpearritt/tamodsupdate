Based on Shreq's potatoHud. Modifications made to be a bit closer to the standard T:A UI.

Differences from potatoHud:

* Health/Energy in lower left corner
* Health/Energy bars are segmented
* Speed bar added on the left of the screen
* Weapon listing moved to the bottom of the screen
* Weapon listings show the names of equipped weapons
* Flag holders appear under the scores rather than beside them
* Generator power indicator disabled (the IFF marker still shows gen status)
* No diagonal crosshair line for explosives
* No ammo count near the crosshair
* Chat and killfeed locations switched to be more like regular T:A positioning
* If there are no spectators, a message to that effect is shown on the scoreboard
